!!!UPDATE: Now later, I was thinking if the Person class has as arguments a name and date of birth. Then an extra method should be added which calculate the person's age. A method where I get the date today and calculate the years from the date of birth to current day.

Requirements: "ïƒ¨ Vrem sa aflam daca o persoana este majora sau nu. Se va defini o clasa Java si o metoda care
verifica daca o persoana este majora."

The class code required is in src/Person.java.
I have uploaded all the sources file from IntelliJ.
